# TedTalkTitle-Generation-LSTM

The provided code implements a text generation model using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells. The text generation is based on an input dataset containing details on Ted Talks. Below is the methodology for the code:

1. Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the TED Talk dataset containing titles into a data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame).
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, including the relevant columns.

2. Text Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Preprocess the title text to make it suitable for training.
Convert titles to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Perform additional text cleaning steps, such as removing special characters or irrelevant information.

3. Tokenization:

Tokenize the preprocessed title text to convert it into sequences of integers.
Utilize a tokenizer, such as the one provided by Keras, to fit on the title text and generate sequences.

4. N-gram Sequence Generation:

Create n-gram sequences from the tokenized titles to capture the context for predicting the next word.
Prepare input-output pairs where the input is an n-gram sequence, and the output is the next word in the sequence.

5. Padding Sequences:

Pad the generated n-gram sequences to ensure uniform length for model input.
Use padding techniques to handle sequences of varying lengths.

6. Feature-Label Splitting:

Split the padded sequences into features (X) and labels (y), where y is the representation of the next word (e.g., one-hot encoded).

7. Model Architecture:

Define a text generation model using a Sequential model, similar to the one used for Drake song generation.
Include layers such as Embedding, LSTM (possibly Bidirectional), and Dense for generating the next word in the sequence.

8. Model Training:

Train the model using the prepared features (X) and labels (y) from the TED Talk dataset.
Utilize categorical crossentropy as the loss function and an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam).

9.Training Visualization:

Visualize the training process by plotting training accuracy and loss over epochs using tools like Matplotlib.

10. Text Generation:

Use the trained model to generate new TED Talk titles.
Provide a seed text or context to initiate the generation process.
Iteratively predict and append the next word to the seed text, expanding the generated title.

11. Output Analysis:

Evaluate the quality of generated titles.
Consider factors such as coherence, relevance, and diversity.

This methodology provides a structured approach to building a text generation model for TED Talk titles. Adjustments may be necessary based on the characteristics of the TED Talk dataset and the desired outcomes.
